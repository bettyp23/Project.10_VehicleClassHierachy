# Project.10_VehicleClassHierachy
The base class Vehicle contains common attributes such as make, model, color, fuel type, mileage, and year.

This project implements a class hierarchy using inheritance in C++. The base class Vehicle contains common attributes such as make, model, color, fuel type, mileage, and year. Derived classes Car, Truck, Motorcycle, and Boat inherit from Vehicle and introduce unique attributes. The project demonstrates virtual functions, constructors with initialization lists, and polymorphism through a PrintData function.

Features

Implements a base class Vehicle with common attributes.

Derived classes (Car, Truck, Motorcycle, Boat) inherit from Vehicle and define additional attributes.

Uses a virtual function PrintData to print vehicle details.

Implements constructors with initialization lists.

Ensures proper encapsulation with getter and setter functions.

Includes a main.cpp file to test the class hierarchy.

Utilizes a Makefile for compilation.
